--- Sizes ----------
 Website is 1024 px in width.

--- Notes  ---------
- no vertical sizes are standard yet

- the middle of the page can accommodate more 'boxes' of 
interest, optimally up to six boxes. the sample design
has three boxes.

- box4, 5, and 6 is somewhat a variation of box1, 2, and 3.
you can choose to use any combination of the designs, or
not use any of them at all. XD

- other pages (i.e. about, portfolio, etc) may have their
descriptions/information on the 'banner' portion of the 
page, accompanied by some graphic, like a logo or something.
This is similar to how Dropbox did in its about page
(and I also plan to do the same for our members page XD)
