These are semi-final designs for the Soupware websites.

They are in PSD format, 1024px wide, variable px hight.
We will enforce the 1024px width restriction for these
PSD files to minimize file size and to let viewers see
the actual width of the site.

As of today, only 'design-home.psd' is in final form.

Some notes for the potentially confused viewer of the
design-members.psd file:

. yes, it's a copy of the design-home.psd. XD I simply
hid the other elements of the page, but they're still
essentially there. XD

you might find some use with the other elements kasi,
so I left it hidden first. 

if you think that it will surely /not/ be used anymore, 
you can go ahead and delete them. :D you can restore 
them from the original 
file anyway. :D XD

. the graphics on either psd can be freely modified
and edited. :D they're just placeholders, so you can
of course edit them as you wish. :D

. eventually, all the graphics you'll potentially use
in the psd pages must be exported as individual pictures.
Keep that in mind as you make them. :D

That's all! Good luck you guys \;u;/

to edit text (/content), as well, right? ;o;
